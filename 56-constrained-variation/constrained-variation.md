# Constrained Variation

Fix the scaffold. Switch the algorithm. Compare simultaneously.

## Pattern

Hold a set of **constants** stable across all variants. Replace exactly one **variable axis** at a time. Display all results together so differences read as method, not noise.

The constants are not limitations — they are the reference frame that makes variation legible.

## Structure

```
constants:     palette, grid, timing loop, base substrate, labels
variable axis: the draw function — one hypothesis per cell
output:        simultaneous display of all variants
```

## Why It Works

Without a stable reference, variation is invisible. The eye needs something fixed to perceive what changed. Constants do this work silently — they collapse all irrelevant dimensions so the one you're exploring becomes the only signal.

Simultaneous display is the other key move. Sequential iteration produces *search* (looking for the best). Simultaneous display produces *taxonomy* (mapping the space). You're not optimizing — you're taking a cross-section.

## Axes

Each constant can become the next variable. Each swap reveals a different cross-section of the same possibility field.

| constant (now) | becomes variable (next) |
|---|---|
| palette | same algorithms, different colors |
| grid geometry | same algorithms, different layout |
| base substrate | same algorithms, different source image |
| timing | same algorithms, different frame rate / phase |
| algorithm count | same algorithms, 16 cells instead of 8 |

The possibility field doesn't grow by adding freedom — it grows by **choosing which dimension to open next**.

## Analogues

- **Type specimens** — same text, different typefaces
- **Paint studies** — same subject, different light or medium
- **Jazz standards** — same chord changes, different soloists
- **Design systems** — same component, different states
- **Modular synthesis** — same signal path, different modules
- **A/B testing** — same interface, one variable changed

## In Practice

1. Identify what is truly fixed (palette, structure, rules)
2. Identify the one axis you want to explore
3. Generate variants along that axis
4. Display simultaneously — resist the urge to cull before comparing
5. Read the taxonomy: what character does each approach have?
6. Choose the next axis to open

## Notes

The simultaneous display constraint is load-bearing. If you iterate and discard, you're searching. If you hold all variants alive, you're mapping. The difference in mindset is significant — mapping tolerates bad variants because they define the edges of the space.

Constraints don't limit the possibility field. They **define** it.
