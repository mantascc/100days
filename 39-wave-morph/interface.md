# Day 39: Wave Morph

## Idea
Audio waveform morphing between different wave types (sine, triangle, square, sawtooth) with interactive slider

## Description
This project visualizes smooth transitions between four fundamental audio waveforms: sine, triangle, square, and sawtooth. A slider controls morphing between waveform types, with play/pause controls for animation. The canvas visualization shows the current waveform shape with labeled positions (SIN, TRI, SQR, SAW). The implementation demonstrates audio synthesis principles through visual representation and smooth interpolation between distinct waveform shapes.

## Data Concepts
- **Primary**: Audio (waveform types, signal processing, audio synthesis)
- **Secondary**: Temporal (animation cycles, morphing transitions), Visual (waveform rendering)

## Stack
- HTML5 Canvas
- Vanilla JavaScript (modular)
- CSS

## Notes
- The four waveforms represent fundamental building blocks of audio synthesis
- Sine: pure tone, triangle: softer harmonics, square: odd harmonics, sawtooth: all harmonics
- Smooth morphing demonstrates continuous spectrum between discrete waveform types
- Visual representation bridges abstract audio concepts with tangible graphics
- Play/pause enables observation of static vs animated waveforms
