# Day 36: React/TypeScript Project

## Idea
Vite-powered React application with TypeScript (specific features not visible in entry HTML)

## Description
This project uses modern React development stack with Vite build tool and TypeScript. The minimal HTML entry point delegates to React application mounted at root div. Vite provides fast development server, hot module replacement, and optimized production builds. TypeScript adds static typing and enhanced developer experience. The actual application logic resides in /src/main.tsx and associated modules.

## Data Concepts
- **Primary**: (Determined by application logic in main.tsx)

## Technical Tags
#react #typescript #vite #tsx #hot-module-replacement

## Stack
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Modern JavaScript (ES modules)

## Notes
- Vite provides significantly faster builds than webpack-based Create React App
- TypeScript integration enables type-safe React components
- The project represents shift from vanilla JS to professional frontend tooling
- Entry point simplicity reflects build tool handling complexity
