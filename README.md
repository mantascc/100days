# 100 Days of Creative Coding

A co-worker inspired 100-day skill development routine.

**Theme:** AI-assisted creative coding focusing on data expression and investigation of coding concepts.

This collection explores the intersection of human creativity and artificial intelligence. Each day represents a sketch, a prototype, or an experiment using generative algorithms, physics simulations, interactive interfaces, and data visualization.
