# Day 19: Coworker Network (React)

## Idea
Force-directed graph visualization of coworker relationships built with React and TypeScript

## Description
This project is a React/TypeScript implementation exploring network visualization of coworker relationships. Built using modern frontend tooling (Vite), it demonstrates force-directed graph layout with interactive components. The project showcases a shift from vanilla JavaScript to a component-based architecture with type safety and build tools.

## Data Concepts
- **Primary**: Network (coworker relationships, organizational structure)
- **Secondary**: Spatial (force-directed layout)

## Conceptual Tags
#force-directed-graph #react #typescript #organizational-networks #component-architecture #modern-frontend

## Technical Tags
#react #typescript #vite #d3-force #component-based #build-tools

## Stack
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite (build tool)
- D3-Force (likely)
- Tailwind CSS (based on className patterns)

## Notes
- Represents a shift in the 100 days series from vanilla JS to modern React/TS tooling
- Likely extends the force-directed graph concepts from Days 16-17 with component-based architecture
- The project requires a build step (npm/yarn) unlike previous single-file projects
- CoworkerForceTimeGraph component suggests temporal or time-based network evolution
- Demonstrates professional frontend development practices with TypeScript type safety
