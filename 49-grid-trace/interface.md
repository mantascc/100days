# Day 49: Grid Trace

## Idea
Animated grid with path-tracing effects and typewriter text using Geist Pixel Square font

## Description
This project creates visual traces across a dot grid, with paths animating between dots creating dynamic network patterns. Centered text uses Typed.js library for typewriter effect, displayed in Geist Pixel Square font - a custom pixel font that matches the grid aesthetic. The combination of grid animation and typing text suggests data transmission or network activity visualization. Black background (#0a0a0a) with white dots and text creates high contrast retro-digital aesthetic.

## Data Concepts
- **Primary**: Spatial (grid layout, path-tracing, network visualization)
- **Secondary**: Temporal (animation paths, typewriter timing), Visual (dot patterns, line drawing)

## Stack
- HTML5 Canvas
- Typed.js (typewriter library)
- Geist Pixel Square font
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Notes
- Geist Pixel Square font creates cohesive pixel aesthetic matching grid visualization
- Path tracing between dots suggests data flow, network packets, or neural connections
- Typewriter effect adds temporal narrative dimension to spatial grid
- Spacing parameter (15px) determines grid density and path resolution
- Active paths likely animate from dot to dot creating flowing visual rhythm
- The project combines retro pixel aesthetic with smooth modern animation
